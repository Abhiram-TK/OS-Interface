# OS Interface

Welcome to OS Interface, a robust operating system interface crafted using Go Language and the Fyne Framework. This project brings together various independent applications seamlessly integrated into one cohesive interface. From a weather app powered by OpenWeatherAPI to a versatile gallery, audio player, calculator, text editor, and an efficient email sender.

‚ú® Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance your digital experience with OS Interface!

## Installation & Setup:

1. Download Go from [official website](https://go.dev/).
2. Install Go and verify the installation using `go --version`.
3. Download TDM-GCC Compiler from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/).
4. Install TDM-GCC Compiler and verify using `gcc --version`.

## Run Locally:

### Install Fyne ToolKit Library

To install the library, run the following code in your terminal:

```bash
  go get fyne.io/fyne/v2@latest
```

This is a common way to manage dependencies in Go projects using the `go get` command.

### Customize Image Path:

To set the background image path, follow these steps:

1. Open **osInterface.go**.
2. Locate the line:

```bash
  img = canvas.NewImageFromFile("D:\\OS Interface\\osbg.jpg")
```

3. Update the file path according to your local setup.

### OpenWeatherAPI Setup:

To use the OpenWeatherAPI in your project, follow these steps:

1. Get API Key:
- Sign up on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).
- Generate and copy the API key.

2. Update **weather.go**:

- Locate the line:

```bash
  resp, err := http.Get("https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + selection + "&appid=example")
```

- Replace example with the copied API key.

Now your project is set up to fetch weather data using your personal OpenWeatherAPI key.

### SMTP Setup

To integrate SMTP for sending emails in your project, follow these steps:

1. Get SMTP Key: 
- Sign up on [Brevo](https://onboarding.brevo.com/account/register).
- Generate and copy the SMTP key.
   
2. Update **sendmail.go**:
   
- Locate the Line:

```bash
  dailer := gomail.NewDialer("smtp-relay.brevo.com", 587, "username", "password")
```

- Replace **username** with your login email.
- Replace **password** with your SMTP key value.

Now your project is set up to use the SMTP server for sending emails from A to B.

### Run the Project

To run the project, execute this code in your terminal:

```bash
  go run .\osInterface.go .\weather.go .\gallery.go .\audioplayer.go .\calculator.go .\texteditor.go .\sendmail.go
```

Now, your project is ready to go! üöÄ
